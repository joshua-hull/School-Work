ABSTRACT
Generate an alphamask from a greenscreen image and composite it onto a
background image. Example image in composited.png created with given
parameters.txt

COMPILING
Simply type 'make' from the root directory. Compiles both alphamask and
composite.

PARAMATERS
* input_image: The greenscreen image who's alpha mask we are computing.
Required.
* output_image: input_image with it's alpha mask computed. Required.
* foreground_image: Four channel foreground image. output_image from alphamask.
Required.
* background_image: Three or four channel background image. Required.
* composited_image: Filename where composited image can be written to. Optional.

parameters.txt stores the parameters for composite. They are minHue, MaxHue,
minValue, maxValue, minSaturation, maxSaturation. They are in that order, each
on a new line. Sample provided.

INTERACTION
* Press 'q', 'Q', or ESC to exit the program.
* Press 'w' or 'W' to write the image to composited_image. If no
composited_image is given then no image is written.

BUGS
Currently only computes binary alpha mask with alpha = 0.0 when hue is between
minHue and maxHue. All other parameters in parameters.txt are ignored.

1.) bell9.filt convolved with square.png resulted in a blurred image. Output to
 bell9.png.

 box9.filt convolved with square.png resulted in another blurred
 image but not as blurred as before. Output to box9.png.

 tent9.filt convolved with square.png resulted in a third blurred image but this
 one less blurry then the other two. Output to tent9.png

2.) pulse.filt convolved with brushes.png results in a blurred version of the
 image. Results written to pulse.png.

  tent.filt convolved with brushes.png results in a blurred image that also
  smooths out the grainy background. Results written to tent.png.

  hp.filt convolved with brushes.png results in a inverted image detecting the
  edged in the image. Areas of the image that are not edges are black, edges
  are highlighted. Results written to hp.png

  sobol-horiz.filt convolved with brushes.png results in an inverted image with
  edge detection on the vertical direction. Results written to sobol-horiz.png

  sobol-vert.filt convolved with brushes.png results in an inverted image with
  edge detection on the horizontal direction. Results written to sobol-vert.png

3.) experiment1.filt is a vertical banding filter that is weighted towards the
 edges and tapers in to the center. It results in similar to a normal vertical
 edge detection filter.

 experiment2.filt is a filter that calculates the hyperbolic cosine of the sum
 of the indexes of the filter. So if the filter is an N by N filter then
 filter[i][j] = cosh((i+1)+(j+1)) for i in 0...N-1. The result is an image that
 is blurred and visibly shifted down and to the right. Results written to

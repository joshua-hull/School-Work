Usage: oiioview input_image [output_image]

ABSTRACT
Display an image given on the command line to an OpenGL window and write to
an optional output file given from the command line. Also allow the user to
click on the image in order to display the pixel information about the
location they clicked on via the terminal.

COMPILING
Simply type 'make' from the root directory.

PARAMATERS
* input_image: The image to load into the OpenGL window. Required.
* output_image: The image name to write to disk. Optional. If not given then no
image will be written on pressing 'w'.

INTERACTION
* Press 'q', 'Q', or ESC to exit the program.
* Press 'w' or 'W' to write the image to output_image. If no output_image is
given then no image is written
* Click anywhere on the image to display the pixel information to the terminal
window in the format '(x,y) = (XXX,YYY)	RGB = (RRR, GGG, BBB)'.

BUGS
Resizing the OpenGL window results in undefined output to the command line when
the user presses 'W' or 'w'.
